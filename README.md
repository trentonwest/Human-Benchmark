# Human-Benchmark
Python algorithms to play the games on humanbenchmark.com

Use PrintCoords.py to get the list of coordinates youll need for each game
\n  -change the click_count to be how many locations you want
\n  -run it then click every location
\n  -it will print the list of locations after your done clicking

Most of these have lines that you can uncomment to view the screenshots that the program is using, this is handy if you aren't sure that your coordinates are right
